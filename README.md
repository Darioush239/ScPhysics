# ScPhysics
Random thing I wrote when I didn't have Internet.

# Why?
I was extremly bored in Iran during the Internet shutdown and i wrote it.

# How long did this take?
I don't but some hours.

# Does this represnt your coding skills?
Of course! I have no shame in saying i suck xD


# How do i build this and what is this?
To build this run the command 'g++ main.cpp Menu.cpp -O2 -o main.o'
This is supposed to have all of the physics equations of my textbook but i was too lazy and only added the simplest one. everything is there this is quite scalable.
